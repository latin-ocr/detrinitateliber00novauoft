xxxviii INTROD UCTJON

already quoted suffice to shew that Novatian affirms the
‘ always ’ existence of the Word in the Father‚ before the
generation of the Son: however hard it may be to re-
concile such language with his disclaimer of temporal
relations1. The De Trinz'tate indicates for us a fresh
moment in the progress of Christian thought towards
the great formula of Athanasius, the Λόγος ὁμοούσιος in
which Sabellian modalism and Gnostic subordinationism
alike found their corrective. From the first a true instinct
led the Church to reject any view of the Incarnation
which represented it as a transient theophany.

The pre-existence of the Eternal Word is a dogma
for which the current Christology of Germany is content
to find an explanation by reference to the Platonic
philosophy of the Idea. Harnack‚ in a learned and
exhaustive excursus on the subject2, thinks he can trace
its genesis from the convergence of Judaic and Hellenic
lines of thought. On the one hand there are the Jewish
speculations as to a ‘pattern’ of earthly existences‚ things
and persons, ‘ laid up in heaven3'3 on the other hand, the
Platonic notion of νοούμενα and φαινόμενα, spiritual con-
ceptions taking a fleshly veil which was their inadequate
manifestation. The critic then avers that there is a
difference of view as regards the Person of Jesus Christ
between the New Testament writers, between Paul, the
author of ‘ Hebrews,⁷ of the Apoczssypse, of Ι Peter, and
the Fourth Evangelist3 the last-named alone distinctly

¹ Amniundsen rightly explains the ‘semper' as meaning ‘before all
time' rather than ‘in ete1·nity.' in view of such language as ‘antecedat
necesse est eum, qui hahet originem, ille qui originem nescit' (p. 117,
l. 7 sq.)‚ Nor». ogrN22·‹1[2'a122‘sneen‚ p. 35.

³ Exocl. xxv 40: Jerusalem, the Temple, the Law; the Patriarchs,
Moses. There was a pre-existent Israel, a pre-existent Messiah‚ in the
thought os God: Harnack, l.c. and i 98.
