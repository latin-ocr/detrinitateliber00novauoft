retur. narn et liber esse debuerat, ne incongruenter dei
imago seruiret: et lex addenda, ne usque ad contemptum
dantis libertas effrenata prorumperet: ut et praemia condigna
et merita poenarum consequenter exciperet, suum iam habens
illud, quod motu mentis in alterutram partem agitare uoluis-
set. ex quo mortalitas, inuidia utique, in ipsum redit 3 qui
cum illam de oboedientia posset euadere, in eandem incurrit,
dum ex consilio peruerso deus esse festinat. cuius tamen
poenam nihilominus indulgenter temperauit, dum non tam
ipse, quam labores eius maledicuntur super terra. nam et
quod requiritur, non ex ignorantia uenit, sed spem hominis
futurae in Christo et inuentionis et salutis ostendit: et quod

on doceretur, and has displaced
some such word as peccaretur.

lm‘.

1. incongruenter] ‘ anoma-
lously': cp. in a different application
1 Cor. vii 22 ‘seruus libertus Domini.'
50 Greg. Nyss. Cateclz. Or. v sub
fin. εἰ ’γάρ τις ἀνάγκη τῆς ἀνθρωπίνης
ἐπεστάτει ζωῆς, διεψεύσθη ἂν ἡ εἰκὼν
κατ’ ἐκεῖνο τὸ μέρος, ἁλλοτριωθεῖσα
τῷ ἀνομοίῳ πρὸς τὸ ἀρχέτυπον, ‘if
necessity had governed man, the
(Divine) Image would have been
salsified in this respect by its un-
likeness and alienated from its arche-
type.'

2. lex addenda] ‘A law had to
be imposed, sor sear lest an un-
bridled liberty should break out,
even to the contempt of the Giver;
so that man might receive merited
rewards or due punishments as the
result of his actions (consequenter),
henceforth taking as his own doing
[2 Cor. v 10] that which he had
chosen to set in motion, as his mind
swayed him in either (li1·ection.’
This iniplics that in unfallen man
free will is sels—(letermining or nu-
tonomous, not moved from without :

in fact it contains the germ of the
developed Augustinian doctrine on
that matter (eg. in his de Libero
Arbitrio). The relation of free will
to grace in fizllen man is not here
touched upon. Consult Mozley,
Preds‘stination, ch. viii 206 sq., who
quotes the words of Aug. de Corr.
cl Grai. c. xi, the first man ‘had such
an assistance given him as he could
use if he willed, and neglect if he
willed: not one by which it was
caused that he did will!

6. inuidia utique] ‘simply by
envy,’ ‘ by the Devil’s envy of man,'
Gen. iii 5 : cp. wisd. ii 24 ‘inuidia
diaboli intrauit mors in orbem terra-
1·um‚’ and infra p. 13 l. ¹5 n. De
oboed„ ‘by obedience.’ Cf. supra
‘ de institutionis uarietate)

8. deus esse] Gen. iii 5.

9. non tam ipse] Gen. iii 17.

11. quod requiritur...] ‘the
fact that he is sought,’ i.e. in Gen.
iii 9, ‘comes from no ignorance’ on
the part of (jod, ‘but exhibits man’s
hope of a coming rediscovery and
salvation in Christ? For inuenti-
om's et s. see Lk. xix 10 ‘to secl< and
to save?
