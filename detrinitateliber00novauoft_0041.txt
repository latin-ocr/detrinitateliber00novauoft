JNTROD [JCJJON xxxvii

How far is this the case with Novatian ? A study of
the latter part of ch. xvi may serve to shew that his view
is more in accordance with Catholic standards; thus
the words ‘sublata praedestinatione...in substantia fuit
Christus ante mundi institutionem' conform entirely to
the Nicene statement ‘begotten of His Father before
all worlds.’ Again, His coexistence with the Father is
conditioned by His generation before all time, as we
read in ch. xxxi ‘cum sit genitus a patre, semper est
in patre. semper autem sic dico, ut non innatum sed
natum probem. sed qui ante omne tempus est, semper
in patre fuisse dicendus est.' A careful study of that
chapter will reveal a certain distinction between the
views of Novatian and Tertullian. Novatian does with-
out doubt find the purpose of the Son's generation in
the creation of the Universe. Thus we read: ‘hic ergo
quando pater uoluit, processit ex patre: et qui in patre
fuit, quia ex patre fuit, cum patre postmodum fuit, quia
ex patre processit, substantia scilicet illa diuina, cuius
nomen est uerbum, per quod facta sunt omnia, et sine
quo factum est nihil' (p. 118, ll. 5—9). Similarly in
c. xv (p. 50, 17), it is said of the Word, ‘non otiose
prolatum est.’ But the writer is careful not to commit
himself, as Tertullian seems to do. to the statement that
the Son proceeded from the Father not only for the
purpose of, but at the moment of Creation. He says
rather: ‘principium natiuitatis ante omne tempus ac-
cepit' (p. 121, l. 4); and twice in ch. xxxi 3556115 that
the Son's ‘birth' was ‘quando pater uoluit' (pp. 116,
l. 4, 118, l. 5). It is a ‘procession from the Father’
before all time. Beyond this assertion of an extra-
temporal generation the writer does not take 115. He
does not definitely affirm an 61611131 generation of the
Son ‘qua filius dei? It must be added, that the passages
