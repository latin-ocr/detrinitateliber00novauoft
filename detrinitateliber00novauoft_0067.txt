usage, it occurred to Tertullian as the best term for his
purpose: he conceives Almighty God as the ‘tota sub-
stantia' from whom proceed ‘officiales' to administer
His Monarchy'. Thus it indicated essentia] distinctions
in the Godheasl (and particularly in Its operations),
which such a word as species could not have done with-
out risk of Sabellianism. lt was first used by Tertullian
of the Son, through whom the Father speaks: cp. the
Classical ‘personam alicuius suscipere.y He is anxious
to explain that neither ‘substance,' the Godhead or the
Manhood, loses its own ‘proprietas' or is blended into
a ‘tertium quid,' a kind of mixture distinct from either.

but conjoined in One Person2‚’ in which the theological
sense of Person is explicit.

The Greek equivalent in Hippolytus is πρόσωπον,
a word which has a similar stage-origin: cp. adn. Noel.

τὴν χάριν τοῦ ἁνγίου πνεύματος, from which Harnack
infers that as yet it was not attributed to the Holy
Spiritss.

It is well known that ὑπόστασις was the equivalent
preferred in post-Nicene writers, as being free from any
Sabellian suggestion. Like the memorable ὁμοούσιος,
1116 term ‘persona' is not δἐι-19111131, but has approved
itself to the Christian consciousness from the earliest
ages But we must be caresul not to read into it all
that a developed psychology implies, when human

3 Mr Bethune-Baker (l.c. p. 73) thinks that Hippolytus uses the term
as a rendering of ί1161501111,1 which he must have found 111 familiar use
at Rome, where probably he learnt his theology.
