great intellectual gists, in spite of the expressed disap-
proval of the clergy and many 01 the laity1.

From Cyprian we learn that Novatian had been a
follower 01 1116 Stoic philosophy; and we may trace its
influence in his partiality for the syllogism in argument,
as well as in his cosmogony (cf. de Trz'nz'tate c. iii
with notes; and de Spectaculis ix, 11 Novatian’s). It
is certain that by the year ΑΒ. 250 his abilities had
gained him a commanding position among the sorty-
six Roman presbyters. It was in that year, when the
martyrdom of Fabian created a vacancy in the Roman
see, that we find a 6011916 01 letters'2 addressed by
Novatian on behalf of the Roman clergy to Cyprian,
Bishop 01 Carthage, asking 1115 counsel upon the vexed
question of the treatment of the ‘lapsedj i.e. those who
under stress of the Decian persecution had sacrificed.
In both letters there is an austerity of tone in regard to
these offenders, not wholly unmerited in view of their
peremptory demand for indulgence3. The writer is
none the 1655 ready to ‘remit the case to the bishop‚'
as soon as a successor to Fabian should be found, and
meanwhile to confer with bishops, priests, deacons,
consessors and faithful laity elsewhere upon this ques-
