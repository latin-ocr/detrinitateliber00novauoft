Deity ‘ex ipsius dei substantia et ut portio aliqua
totius1.’

Tertullian was the first to give full theological value
to the Sonship of Christ, as distinct from the idea of .
the Logos, which taken by itself might have merged
into the theosophic fancies of the age. He did much to
define the distinction of Persons; but he failed to place
the equality of the Son upon an absolute basis. He was
satisfied to find the ground of the Trinitarian distinction
in the Godhead in the fulfilment of the purpose of
Creation and Redemption. The Valentinian spoke os
the προβολαί of Aeons3 and Tertullian, and Novatian
too, expressed the relation of the Son to the Father in
terms (such as proferri, procedere) which a later theo-
logical instinct has rejected2. And thus the subordination
of the Son to the Father as the source of Deity is stated
in terms which infringe upon His equality within the
Godheadss. In one passage he seems even to deny His
pre—existence ‘fuit auten] tempus, cum...Filius non fuit'
(adn. Hermog. iii), but there it is the Name rather than
the Person that is in question.

Novatian is heir to the Christology of Tertullian‚
and must be studied in connexion with his predecessor.
His gifts are literary rather than philosophie: those of

1 adu. Prax. xxvi: cp. ix ‘pater tota substantia est, filius uero deriuatio
totius et portio': adu. ,Uaria iii 6 ‘filius portio plenitudinis.’ v. Dorner,
op. cil. p. 78.

2 These termS may have been suggested by the Stoic distinction between
the Logos ἐνδιάθετος and προφορικὸς, unspoken thought and thought ex-
pressed: v. c. xv, p. 50, ll. 12—20.

³ Although Tei-tullian asserts His unity of substance. ‘They are called
Two. not as Gods nor as Lords, but qua Father and Son: and that not by
separation of substance, but by disposition, when we prouounce the Son
indiuiduam cl separatum α ῥαῖνε, nec slalu sed gradu alium': and below,
‘One God, from the very fact that He is to be calleci God in virtue of
llis unity with the Father‚’ adn. Frax. xix.
