and his scholarship would have commanded more rc-
spect at Alexandria than it could at Rome and Carthage.
Moreover, Roman Stoicism‚ even as we have it in
Seneca, with whom VVeyman¹ finds in our writer points
of affinity, lacked the breadth of humanism: it is more
akin to the spirit of Calvin than to that of Erasmus.
The Novatianist schism was a revolt against the dis-
cipline, not against the doctrine of the Catholic Church.
VVhatever may be thought of the conformability of
certain statements in the de Tm'm'tate to the Nicene
standard, neither this nor any other of Novatian's works
was disallowed on account os heterodoxy. In fact
these treatises have been preserved solely on their
intrinsic merits. But the writer has paicl the price of
secession : a heavier price indeed than his more eminent
precursor, a man of a kindred spirit, Tertullian. Such
of his writings as survived, survived only under cover
of some other name; they are to be sought among the
supposititious works of Tertullian, Cyprian or Origen.
In the same way, in the fifth century some writings of
Apollinarius were ‘ disseminated under the famous names
of Athanasius, Julius and Gregory Thaumaturgus².’ The
history of the de Trz‘m‘tate, as related in pages xxiii,
xxiv, provides the best example of this survival under
a disguise3 and in the same way, the pastoral letter
known as de Cibis Iudaicis was bound up with the works
of Tertullian. We know that Novatian was a prolific
writer. Jerome mentions the following works of his,
in addition to the above-named : de Pascha, de Sabbata,
de Circzmzcz‘sz'one, de Sacerdote, de Oratione, de sustantia
(‘of perseverance under trial ’), de Attal03. He also
