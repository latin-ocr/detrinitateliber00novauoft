N. understands the text to mean,
“He did not think His Divinity
(‘in forma dei esse’) an equality
with God, which would have been
a usurpation, ’' or arrogation to Him—
selfof that which was not His. The
force of rapinam can only be fixed
by the context. But in Tertull. also,
adu. Prax. vii, it seems to be taken
in the same sense, as generally by the
Latin Fathers (Lightfoot, ad l.c.).

1. hoc est, hominem illum fieri]
is perhaps a gloss, as the introduction
ofthe emphatic illum m ay be thought
to shew. It breaks the How of the
sentence. Is it is to stand, the ‘et
substantians which follows must be
coupled to ‘forn1a1n‚' not to ‘homi-
ne1n.’

2. quam ex paternorum sq.]
‘ which He took upon Him by His
birth, as it came to Him from the
servitude of the sins of His fore-
sathers according to His 1nanhood.'
N. evidently understands the ‘forma
serui’ to be connected with sin and
the loss of tme freedom which it
involves. Doubtless St Paul in-
tended it to denote the position of

a creature, without any reference to
sin. It would not be easy to recon-
cile N.’s language with the usual
belief of Christendom with regard
to the sinlessness of the humanity
assumed by Christ. But perhaps
he did not mean to assert that the
humanity as actually assumed by
Christ was in a state of sinful servi-
tude, but only that it ‘came’ to
Him from those who were in such
a state.

13. nisi quoniam auctoritas...]
‘but in fact the majesty of the
Divine XVord, condescending for
the time being to take Manhood
upon Him, and not putting forth
His full powers, lowers and brings
Himselfdown for a time, while bear-
ing the humanity which He has taken
upon Him.⁷ On this sels-limitation
