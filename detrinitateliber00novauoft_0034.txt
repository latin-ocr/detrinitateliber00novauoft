as ‘the Lord‚' ‘the Son of God,’ ‘our Saviour,' ‘the
Master‚' and to await His speedy return in glory. The
Gnostic heresies, which threatened the adulteration of
Christianity with a fantastic philosophy, compelled
Christian thinkers to find some more satisfying formula;
or rather, sent thern back to the New Testament to find
the elements of such a formula in the Johannine doctrine
of the Logos. The like may be said of the Catholic
reply to the Ebionite teaching, which reduced our Lord
to the place of a second Moses. At the beginning of the
third century two tendencies of thought were apparent:
the Humanitarian view of Christ, which is represented
by the ‘rationalistic Monarchians' (better named
‘Adoptianists,’ as holding that Jesus Christ was merely
the adopted Son of the Father¹‚ who received Divine
δύναμις at His baptism); and the view of the Modalist
Monarchians‚ of whom Sabellius was the best-known
representative. As against the former, it was necessary
to establish His equality with the Father2. As against
the latter, with whom the Patripassians3 are to be classed,
it was necessary to establish the distinction of Persons in
the Trinity. This could not be done without a careful

³ The l’atripassians (lenied the distinct I'ersonality of the Son. Chief
among them were Praxeas and Noetus, both favoured by the Popes of their
day, Victor and Callistus. Praxeas taught that the Father became man and
suffered in Jesus Christ: ‘ipsum patrem descendisse in uirginem, ipsum ex
ea natum, ipsum passum, denique ipsum esse Iesum Christum ' (Tertull. adu.
Praxean i). The Patripassians may be called ‘modalistic Monarchians‘:
i.e. they insisted on the Unity os the Godhead to this extent, that they
represented the Trinity as denoting three ‘modes' of manifestation, not

Three Persons in the Godhead. W'e have a further development in the
teaching of Sabellius.
