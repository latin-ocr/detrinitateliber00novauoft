1. hic ergo cum sit gemtus sq.]
Generation from the Father implies‚
N. says, that the Son was always in
the Father. This step in the argn-
ment he does not explain; but pro-
bably he means that such a relation-
ship, in the case of the Divine Being,
must necessarily be eternal.

2. semper autem sic sq.] N.
must wish to combat one of two
errors. As the Son is always in the
Father‚ it might be thought that
His birth had not already taken
place, before all time. Or, sor the
same reason, it might be thought
that the Son 1135 110 birth at 311,
but has an independent and self-
originated existence. In the former
case, ‘innatum’ would mean ‘not
yet born.’ But the use of‘ natus ' and
61111131115’1101011·(11. 1 19. 5 sq.) is con-
clusive for the latter view. N. says
therefore that this· coeternal exist-
ence of the Son does not mean 311
independent existence, but a deriva-
tive one; only (sed), where ques—
tions of tirne are out of place, we
must say that this derived existence
1135ι always⁷ been. v. Introd. §4,
p. xxxvii.

1113111101,53)5, ‘it is most certain that

This argument for the eternity of
the Son 15 implied in the words of
Irenaeus iv 11. 5 (11311ογ), 111 con-
nexion 111111 ‘reuelauerit' of Matr.

It appears again in Origen Prmc. i
2. 10, 11 28.

6. quia et pater cet.] It is
clear that in the supposed interests
of orthodoxy as against Arianism
some liberties have been taken with
the original text ofthis chapter. The
qualifying phrases quadam ratione,
and in the next clause quodam modo,
and in the following sentence aliquo
pacto before anlecedat, were wanting
in cod. Angl. but interpolated (ac-
cording to Pamelius) by Gangneius.
The ed. of Gelenius reads them
without brackets. At the same time
these interpolations fairly represent
the mind of Ν, for the whole con-
text shews that he did not intend
‘ praecedit' to have a strictly tem-
poral sense. Again, the sentence
simul ut lzz'c minor to nascitur, and
lower down the words sed post
Patrem, and again post Patrem qua
Filius‚are due tocod. Angl. 1 Gelenius
omits them. Cf. n. on p. 119. 16
below.
