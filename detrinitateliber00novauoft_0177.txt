XXIX] DE TRINJTATE LIBER 109
unxit te, deus, deus tuus oleo laetitiae a consortibus tuis. de

hoc apostolus Paulus: qm' em'm spiritum Clzrz'sli non hahet,
lzz'c non est eius ,· et: aba· spz‘m‘tus domini, ibi libertas.
Hic est qui operatur ex aquis secundam natiuitatem, semen

quoddam diuini generis, et consecrator caelestis natiuitatis, 5

pignus promissae hereditatis, et quasi chirographum quoddam
aeternae salutis; qui nos dei faciat templum, et nos eius
efficiat domum. qui interpellat diuinas aures pro nobis gemiti-
bus ineloquacibus, aduocationis implens officia, et defensionis
exhibens munera, inhabitator corporibus nostris datus, et
sanctitatis effector 3 qui id agens in nobis ad aeternitatem et ad
resurrectionem immortalitatis corpora nostra producat, dum
illa in se assuefacit cum caelesti uirtute misceri, et cum spiritus
sancti diuina aeternitate sociari. erudiuntur enim in illo et
per ipsum corpora nostra ad immortalitatem proficere, dum ad

1 te, deus, deus tuus sic legitur apud Tertull. adu. Prax. xiii.

Baptism: and in the present striking 9. Rom. viii 26 Vulg. ‘inenar-

passage, the ‘seal’ os Unction and
the Laying-on of Hands is not men-
tioned. Dr Mason (Relate‘on of Con·
firmalion lo Baptism, p. 122) thinks
that the writer's ‘silence concerning
the “seal” may be interpreted as in
the case of other ancient authors
who ascribe the gift of the Holy
Ghost to “ Baptism’⁷ ;——Baptisni im-
plicitly including it.' The twofold
occurrence in the passage of the
word unxit, in the quotations‚ makes
for that view. Cornelius, Bp of
Rome, in a letter to Fabius, Bp of
Antioch, says that Novatian was
privately baptized in sickness: and
affirms that ‘when he recovered, he
never obtained the remaining things
which a man ought to partake of
according to the Church rule, and
was never sealed by the Bishop.’
On this question v. Mason, op. cit.

1 1. qui id agens sq.] ‘So doing
in us to bring our bodies to eternity
and to the resurrection of im-
mortality‚ while He accustoms them
in His own person [or rather, in
Himself] to be conjoined with
heavenly powers and to be as-
sociated with the Divine eternity
of the Holy Spirit’ (Mason l.c.).
For ‘producat’ cp. p. 63. 11. The
passage proceeds from the thought
ofthe indwelling Spirit to that of a
transfigured humanity, ‘ heavenly,’
‘ immortal‚’ ‘ (livine.' Dr Moberly
(Atouement, p. 275) speaks of ‘the
universal principle, that the Pente-
costa] Church is Πνεῦμα; and there-
fore that everything in the Church
is what it is only within the region,
and informing principle, of spirit)
