position will reveal certain points of difference.—Christ
is ‘dominus deus noster, sed dei filius’ (c. ix initi). It
is not necessary to traverse again the ground already
covered by us in treating of the Fre-existence of the
Son. But this much may be said here. As He is God
in His origin, He was glorified in His personal essence
before the world was established, and was with God to
receive His command that the world should be created;
and as the VVord of God He descended from heaven.
On earth, He shews that He knows the secrets of man's
beart, He forgives sins, He heals diseases, He assures
man of immortality and even of divinity1‚ He is omni-
present to be invoked in worship2, and He bestows that
enduring salvation which mere man could not give³.
If we allow that He is Son of God, we are bound to
confess him God⁴. And yet He has Himself stated
‘on what principle' He is God, namely, ‘as the Son of
God born (natus) of God,' or, ‘as being the Son, not the
Fatlier⁵.' From the crucial passage in Philippians ii
the writer argues that He never placed Himself on the
same level with the Father, ‘remembering that He has
what He is simply by the Father's gift& The Father
is ‘immensus’ i.e. subject to no local limitations; the
Son is, or may be, ‘confined in space‚⁷ coming, as the
prophet said, from the South, in other words, from
Bethlehem (c. xii, p. 41 sq.)⁷. The argument against
the Sabellians requires that this should refer to Him
as God and not merely as Man.

Again, God the Father is invisible, no human eye can
contemplate Him: He transcends the reach of thoughtss.
