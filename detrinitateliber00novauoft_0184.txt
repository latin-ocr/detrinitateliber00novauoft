tor, solus originem nesciens, inuisibilis, immensus, immortalis,
aeternus, unus deus 3 cuius neque magnitudini neque maies-
tati neque uirtuti quicquam, non dixerim praeferri, sed nec

comparari potest.

ex quo, quando ipse uoluit, sermo filius

5 natus est: qui non in sono percussi aeris, aut tono coactae de
uisceribus uocis accipitur, sed in substantia prolatae a deo

uirtutis agnoscitur.

cuius sacrae et diuinae natiuitatis arcana

nec apostolus didicit, nec prophetes comperit, nec angelus
sciuit, nec creatura cognouit 3 filio soli nota sunt, qui patris

1 0 secreta cognouit.

1. originem nesciens] ‘without
origin': the classicisni is rather inis-
leading here. Cp. the description
ofthe Stoic ‘qui nesciat [=nequeat]
irasci‚’ Juv. x 60.

4. quando ipse uoluit] i.e.
‘when tlte Fatlzerwilled⁷z compare
p. 1 18. 5, quando Pater uoluit. The
same thought appears in Hippo-
lytus c. Nectum, chs. x, xi. Cp.
also Dorner Ι ii 86, who quotes from
that Father, ‘when it was God's will,
He shewed His Logos as He willed,
at the times afore appointed by
Him.’ On this question see Peta-
vius de Trim'ttzte, vi 8. Thetendency
of these earlier Fathers is to reg'ard
theTrinity as ‘ oeconomic‚' not ‘ hypo-
static,’ i.e. to treat the indication of
distinctions in the Divine Nature as
relative to the Divine action in time,
rather than as absolute and eternal.

Dorner remarks upon this subject,
‘distinctions confirm unity, for a
unity evolved out of distinctions is
more compact and self-sufficient'
(ib. 83). On the analogy of human
personality see Dr Illingworth, Per-
sonalily Human ancl Divine, pp. 67
—71,and Note 12.

:- non 'm sono...] ‘who is not
understood as a sound that strikes
the air or a tone os the voice forced
from the lungs, but is acknowledged
in the sense of a substantive power
put forth by God.’ Cf. Bull, Dtgf.
Fid. Nic. iii 8, ἓ 6 sq. The words
are plainly directed against the Mo-
dalist definition of the Logos in
Stoic terms, as ἀὴρ πεπληγμένος ἢ
τὸ ἴδιον αἰσθητὸν ἀκοῆς (Diog. Laert.
55). The writer follows Tertullian
adu. Prax. vii ‘quid est enim, dices,
sermo nisi uox et sonus oris et, sicut
grammatici tradunt, aer offensus?
Hippol. Philas. x 33 Θεὸς λόγον ἀπο-
Ὑεννᾷ, οὐ λόγον ὡς φωνήν. Harnack,
D. G. i³ 69711.

6. in substantia cet.] N. uses
the word ‘ substantia ' in this chapter
to represent ὑπόστασις, in a sense
verging upon that of ‘person‚' not
in its usual sense of ‘substance‘ or
‘ essence’ (Heb- i 3) 3 cp. p. 1 18. 7, 8
‘ substantia illa diuina, cuius nomen
est uerbum’ ‘Being.' In p. 57. ²4 we
have ‘ in substantia fuit Christus
ante mundi institutionem,’ ¹ personal
essence.’
