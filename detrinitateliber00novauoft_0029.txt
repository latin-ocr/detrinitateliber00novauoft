but unfortunately Gelenius does not particularise the
readings of that MS. I have examined this edition care-
sully and noted its important readings.

The next editor, Jacob Pamelius of Bruges, who
published an edition of Tertullian (first edition, Antwerp,
1579), was the first to issue the de Trinitate (and the
de Cib. Iudaicis)⁴ under the name of Nox-anan, and to
divide it into chapters. He expresses his obligation to
another ancient British MS, citing its readings in his
notes) and describing it as ‘Anglicum MS exemplar Dn.
Joannis Clementis.' In the absence of all manuscript
evidence, these citations afford valuable evidence for the
text of the treatise1.

Oxford has the honour of having produced the first
separate edition of the de Trinitate, with notes by
Edward VVelchman, in the year 1724, This was quickly
followed by the edition ofJohn Jackson (London, 1728),
which exhibits a stronger theological grasp and greater
critical power. Up to the present time Jackson has
spoken the last word; for the Venice edition of the
fathers by Gallandi (1767) follows his text, and is in
its turn followed by Migne (Patrologiae Latinae tom.
iii 861—970).

It is difficult to see how any substantial improvement
can be made in the text, until some fortunate scholar
lights upon a manuscript of merit. W'e may think that
we trace (especially in the last chapter) the hand of the
theological redactenr, who prefers an orthodox to a pure
text: nor is it wonderful that this has happened, when
we find Arnobius the younger roundly quoting its

that in the 16th cent. the MSS after passing through the Froben press were
not uncommonly handed over to the printers, as being of no further use.
