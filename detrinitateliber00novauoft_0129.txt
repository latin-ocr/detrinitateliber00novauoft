illic Ipsorum linguas nl non audiat unusqm‘sque nocent proximi

homines tunc illos uisitare quaerentem? deum patrem? ergo
iam loco cluditur: et quomodo ipse omnia complectitur? aut
numquid angelum cum angelis dicit descendentem, et dicen· 5
tem: uenite el mox descendamus, el confundamus illic ipsorum
linguas? sed enim in Deuteronomio animaduertimus rettulisse
deum haec, deumque dixisse, ubi ponitur: cnm disseminaret
filios Adam, statuit fines gentium iuxta nnmerum angelornm dei.
neque ergo pater descendit, ut res indicat3 neque angelus ista 10

praecipit, ut res probat.

superest ergo, ut ille descenderit, de

quo apostolus Paulus: qni descendit, {pse est qni ascendit super
omnes caelos, ut impleret onznia, hoc est dei filius, dei uerbum.
uerbum autem dei caro factum est, et habitauit in nobis: hic
erit Christus: deus ergo pronuntiabitur Christus. 15

It is a more satis-
factory view that ‘et mox' forms
part os the quotation, which answers
to δεῦτε καὶ καταβάντες σινγχέωμεν
of LXX. It may be conjectured
that some such word as τάχα had
found its way into the Greek text
aster καί, and that N.'s version re-
produces this.

5. numquid angelum cet.] scil.
it was no mere Angel.

7. Deut. xxxii 83 Vulg. ‘ Quando
separabat filios Adam, constituit
terminos populorum iuxta numerum
filiorum Israel': but LXX has ὡς
διέσπειρεν υἱοὺς Ἀδάμ, ἔστησεν ὅρια
ἐθνῶν κατὰ ἀριθμὸν ἀγγέλων θεοῦ.
The argument is contained in
‘rettulisse deum haec‚⁷ scil. ‘non
angelum.' N. makes the ‘dissemi-
natio’ refer to the dispersion at
the Tower of Babel.

11. ut ille descenderit] Bp
Bull D. F. N. lv iii holds that the
ante-Nicene Fathers for the most part
expressed themselves unguardedly,
in their zeal to prove, as against the
heretics, that the Person ofthe Son is
distinct from the Father. Thus they

descendamus.’

Ecce idem Moyses refert alio in loco, quod

seem to forget that the nature ofthe
Son is no less ‘inuisibilis et im-
mensa’ than that of the Father. In
reality‚ however, they held that the
Son, as having His origin from the
Father‚ can hold the office of Ange]
or Announcer of His Will, and
while equally invisible and ‘in-
comp1·ehensible‚’ did ⁸ by way of an
economy' shew Himself in certain
places to men by means of certain
sensible symbols of His presence.
