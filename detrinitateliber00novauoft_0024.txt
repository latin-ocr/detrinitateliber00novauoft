fine satirical passage in de spect. v on those who could
tell a horse's pedigree sor generations (‘memoriter totam

of the Gospel story. Other features are his command
of Virgilian diction¹‚ and of Classical prose rhythm2
especially noticeable in the clausulae of his paragraphS.
A test of a different kind is to be found in a study of
the quotations, which conform to the type represented
by the Old Latin versions (based on the Septuagint),
rather than to the Hebrew text as it was afterwards
rendered in the Vulgate3.

Of the other treatises, the dc Bono Pudicitiae, an

Laud. Mna-tyr. constantly conforms to this.

more than two Old Latin versions: cp. Studia Bihlz'ca (Oxford) i 011 the
