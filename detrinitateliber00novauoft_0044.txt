the mould of Greek philosophie thought : the end deter-
mines the beginning; the δι’ ὅν involves the ἐξ οὗ or in
Other words the idea of Christ as the ἀρχὴ πάσης κτίσεως
(Apoc. iii 14); and we are carried from soteriology into
the sphere of cosmology. But it is otherwise in the
Johannine writings: in which ‘ apart from the Prologue‚
a separation of πνεῦμα (λόγος) and σάρξ in Christ is not
presupposed: it is always the whole Personality to whom
everything exalted applies1.' For, as Harnack conceives,
this Hellenizing of Christian dogma was arrested in
Church teaching by the influence of the Monarchians,
of Athanasius and of Biblical passages which pointed in
another direction.

Against this theory of the evolution of the dogma of
the pre—existence of the Second Person it rnay be urged:
(a) That, except in the Johannine Prologue and
St Paul's speeches at Athens and at Lystra‚ there is
very little indeed in N.T. theology which suggests the
‘acute Hellenisation⁷ on which such stress is laid by
Harnack. We might expect it in the Pauline Epistles,
but we do not find it, whereas we do find expressions
Which remind us of Tertullian's ‘ quid simile philosophus
et Christianus?’²' (b) It cannot be said that the N.T.
contains a single theological treatise. The words of
Harnack, just quoted, on the Johannine idea of ‘the
whole Christ‚' may be set against his treatment of the
historica] Person of Jesus We must not expect to find
a reasoned system and a clear-cut terminology in the
N.T., any more than we can expect to find grammar
before language and logie before thought. Men wrote

1 And therefore, according to Harnaek, ‘for the original readers, if
they were educated Greeks, the Prologue must have been more intelligible ’
than the succeeding narrative.
