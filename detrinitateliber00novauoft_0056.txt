et illa caro corporis& We rnight instance also the
expression of ch. xvii ‘postmodum secundum carnem
hominem2,’ which would be pure tautology, if ‘homo' is
the equivalent of ‘caro' Again, by the very implicatior]
of the metaphors in ‘sponsa caro' and ‘mediator' and
‘conexio mutua3‚’ two natures are united which are in
some sense in pari materia and not the one physical,
the other spiritual. The fact is, that in his anxiety to
dispose of the current fancies of a ‘docetic Christ,’ with
his ‘fabulous body' and ‘sidereal flesh,' whom he apos-
trophises so indignantly in ch. X, Novatian was more
careful to affirm the physical substance than anything
else. It cannot however be denied that, strongly as
he insists upon the close union of the two matures, he
leaves much that is unsatisfying in his treatment of the
Humanity of our Lord. Thus we read in ch. xxiv
(where the notes should be consulted) that the Son of
God is Son in the proper sense (‘legiti1nus’ or ‘princi-
paliter'), but that in a secondary sense that Name
belongs to the ‘Man in virtue of His union with the Son
of God⁴.' This is certainly very like the Nestorianism
(so called) of a later generation.

A more serious point is raised by the words of ch.
xxii2—‘He was content to take upon Him the form of
a slave...and the substance of flesh and body which He
took upon Him by His birth, as it came to Him from
the servitude of the sins of His forefathers according
to His manhood⁵.’ This appears to leave the sinlessness
of the Humanity in doubt; as also does the passage in
ch. xxi which speaks of Christ as ‘cleansing manhood
by His Passion' (‘ abluens ex parte suscepti hominis
