made gods at the beginning, but at first men and then
gods‚’ with a reference to Ps. lxxxii. 6 (v. iv 63. 2, 3)¹.

Undoubtedly there was much in Holy Scripture to
encourage such a speculation: the original account of
man made in the image of God, the teaching about
being made ‘children of God’ (eg. 1 John iii 1, 9),
St Peter's words ‘partakers of the Divine natt1re²'‚
and especially the identification of the believer with
Christ in Pauline teaching. As the expectation of an
imminent Parousia faded from Christian minds, the idea
of a gradual and spiritual regeneration of all things—
a growth of men into the likeness of God—laid an
increasing hold upon them. A vaster reach is given to
the Divine purpose implicit in the Incarnation, which
is thus regarded not as a remedy only for the Fan, but
as God's original and eternal counsel in creationss.

The thought of man's kinship with God and pro-
gressive Deification was no novelty. It may be traced
in Aristotle's words about perfect happiness: ου’ «γὰρ ᾗ
ἄνθρωπός ἐστιν οὕτω βιώσεται, ἀλλ’ ᾗ θεῖόν τι ἐν αὐτῷ
ὑπάρχει, and again, οὐ χρὴ ἀνθρώπινα φρονεῖν ἄνθρωπον
ὅντα...ἀλλ’ ἐφ’ ὅσον ἐνδέχεται ἀθανατίζειν (Nic, Etlz.
x 7. 8). It was a commonplace with the Stoics, who
regarded the human soul as possessing, through reason,
a special relationship to the Divine Being.

The later Stoics use even stronger language, Seneca,

deo ad similitudinem eius qui retro ad imaginem dei suerat: imago in
effigie, similitudo in aeternitate censetur.’ (The simililua'o is something
higher than unfallen manhood, the imago: it is a Deification.)
