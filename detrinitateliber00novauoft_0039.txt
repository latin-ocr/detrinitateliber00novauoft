INTRODUCTION xxxv

be said that his teaching contains an antidote to some
of our modern popular theology. The wide acceptance
of the ‘kenotic’ doctrine, though this doctrine by no
means implies humanitarian views, may encourage a
tendency to forget the other side of the truth as to
the Person of Christ. On the other hand, in regard to
the worship of Christ, Novatian is no less cautious than
the earliest Christians‚ whose prayers were almost always
offered to the Father through the Son, and their worship
to Jesus Christ in His whole Person, the Godhead in the
Manhoodl.

It is the characteristic of Christians that they ‘know
the Father' (Ι Jo. ii 14). In our Vv'estern indifference to
the finer distinctions of doctrine we have fallen into a
form of opinion, which sometimes can scarcely be dis-
tinguished from the Tritheism against which every pious
Jewish Christian would have sternly protested'2‚ and
which has lent itself to transactional theories of the
Atonement. It is safest to keep the exact words of the
New Testament on this matter before our minds. While
Christ and the Father are One, He is the Only Vl'ay to
the Father. And as Christ reveals unto men the Father‚
so the Spirit reveals unto men the things of Christ. In
proportion as the Cliurch assimilates that revelation, she
is animated by the Living Spirit of Christ, and is herself
‘the extension of the Incarnation' for the sake of the
world and indeed of the whole universe.
