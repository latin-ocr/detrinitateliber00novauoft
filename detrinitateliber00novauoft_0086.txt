nec ex fragilitate descendunt 3 propter quod etiam ad corrum-
pendum deum ualere non possunt. materiarum enim in nobis,
ex quibus sumus, diuersitas ad iracundiae consueuit corrum-
pentem nos excitare discordiam 3 quae in deo uel ex natura
5 uel ex uitio non potest esse, dum non utique ex coagmentis

corporalibus intellegitur esse constructus.

est enim simplex, et

sine ulla corporea concretione, quicquid illud est totus, quod

se solus scit esse 3 quandoquidem spiritus sit dictus.

et ideo

haec quae in hominibus uitiosa sunt et corrumpentia, dum ex
corporis ipsius et materiae corruptibilitate nascuntur, in deo
corruptibilitatis uim exercere non possunt, quoniam quidem,
ut diximus, non ex uitio sed ratione uenerunt.

Anger in man is represented as a
conflictos discordant elements in his
nature which ‘ breaks him up ’ (cor-
rumpit) z doubtless the elements of
reason and passion, or the spiritual
and the corporeal. On the othei·
hand God is represented as ‘in any
case understood not to consist of
bodily elements in amalgamation.⁷
⁵ That thole which He alone knows
Hiinself to be, though we cannot
define it [‘quicquid illud est'], is
simple and without the admixture
os anything bodily.’ For the expres-
sion see p. 21 l. 17, with note. The
reference is to Jo. iv ²4· There is
some tendency‚ in Christian thought,
to adopt the Platonic position, a
dualism which disparages the body3
and we are reminded of Virgil’s
purgatory for souls,

‘donec longa dies, perfecto tem-

poris orbe,

concretam exemit labem, purum-

que reliquit

aetherium sensum atque aurai

simplicis igneni,'
Aen. vi 745—747. (Refer to lnlrod.
§5‚ p. lviii.)

But there was always another

tendency os thought, ῖυ which

Tertullian gave an extreme expres-
sion—-‘Who will deny that God,
though He is mind, is also body?
For a spirit is a body of its own
kind after its own image. But even
things invisible have their own
body and their own form with God,
through which they are visible to
God alone’ (adu. Praxean vii).

The solution of the problem (the
relation of finite and infinite
elements) must depend on the
meaning given to the Incarnation
