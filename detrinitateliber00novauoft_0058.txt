in Him1.’ Stress was also laid upon the right choice of
a word to express the conjunction of the two natures,
the passible Man and the impassible God. Nestorius
himself insisted on the word συνάφεια (‘contact’ 01·
‘cohesion ')2‚ in preference to such terms as κρᾶσις, μῖξις,
σύγχυσις. The student of the De Trinitate will find in
it certain anticipations of Nestorian language. Resides
what has been already cited, in regard to Novatian's
treatment of the Humanity of our Lord, we find the
union of the two natures expressed as follows. In c. xxi,
‘the XVord assumes Man and so dwells with Him and in
Him among us, that neither is the humanity (homo)
withdrawn from Christ, nor is the Divinity denied³.'
In c. xxiv, the heretica we are told, wish to make out
that ‘the Man, the Son of Man, is identical with the Son·
of God (eundem atque ipsum, id est hominem filium
hominis etiam filium dei).' Again, in the important
discussion on the words of the Annunciation in the same
chapter, ‘the Son of God in the proper sense [“legiti-
mus”] assumes that Holy Thing, and attaches to Himself
the Son of Man& Another notable expression is found
in the same chapter3 the Son of Man ‘holds on loan
[“ faeneratum et mutuatum''] that which of Himself He
could not possess? The truth is, that Novatian was like
Nestorius in this, that he wished to maintain the true
Manhood no less strenuously than the true Godhead, in
Him who is ‘the pledge of concord between Deity and
Humanity⁵'; and therefore he distrusted any fusion of
