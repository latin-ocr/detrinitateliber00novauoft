Christi praestat immortalitatem, et per immortalitatem
praestat diuinitatem': and xxiX, p. 109, l. II—p. 110,
l. Ι, especially ‘(corpora) assuefacit cum caelesti uirtute
misceri, et cum spiritus sancti diuina aeternitate sociari‚'

and the ‘ fruit of Divinity’; and his very body, in obeying
the decrees of the Spirit, is associated with Its Divine

Vision of God, which itself is immortality. Thus
Irenaeus can say, ‘The glory of God is the living

another place, ‘each received a penny, having as the
king's image and superscription the knowledge of the
Son of God, which was immortality’ (ada. Haer. iv 34. 7
and iv 58. 9, in Harvey's edition). ‘If man had not
been made one with God, he would not have been able
to partake os immortality. For needs was that the
Mediator between God and men should through His
own kinship with either (τῆς ἰδίας πρὸς ἑκατέρους οἰκειό-

(ὁμόνοιαν), and present man to God and make God
known to man' (iii 19. 6): and finally, ‘we were not
