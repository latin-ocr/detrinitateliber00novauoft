viii PREFA CE

their origins and ordered growth is the surest key to
their meaning. There is no better introduction to the
study of Christology than the Treatise of Novatian.
Much that nowadays to the popular mind is new and
modern, is there to be found in germ or tendency. The
Divinely-endowed Man of the Adoptianists has re-
appeared in the Christ of humanitarian theories, and
there are modern critics who dissolve the historical
Christ into an idea as unsubstantial as the Christ of the
Docetic GnostiCS. Again, far removed as is the writer's
standpoint from that of those who disavow “the dividing
line between man’s being and God’s,'’ he can say that
the &Vord of Christ bestows on man divinity. It may
be said in truth, that Novatian is as instructive by his
limitations of insight and definition, as he is by his
positive contribution to the problems of the Creed. For
he is not merely the pale reflexion of Tertullian‚ as
might possibly be inferred frorn dogmatic writers. The
student may think that the Treatise scarcely earns the
title which it has come to bear, and it is true that more
is said about the unity of the Godhead than about Its
tri-personality. But the writer will not allow his sub-
lime conception of the Divine ‘monarchia' to exclude
that other conviction, which Scripture and experience
have rooted in his mind, that Christ is, in a real sense,
God as well as Man.

It has not been an easy matter to prepare, at a
distance from libraries, an edition requiring constant
reference to authorities, and in particular to the earlier
printed texts. Ι am indebted to Mr Falconer Madan, of
the Bodleian Library, to Professor Dr Binz of the Uni-
versity Library at Basel, for practical assistance; to
Prebendary Goudge for the use of the wells Theological
College Library; and to the Rev. E. G. Meyrick wood‚
