Epictetus, Marcus Aurelius, and call the soul a ‘frag-
ment,' ‘emanation‚' ‘ particle' of God, and even roundly
call its reason ‘God1.’ ‘God is near thee‚’ writes Seneca,
‘is with thee, within thee, Lucilius, a sacred spirit is
seated within us.’ ‘ Reason is simply part of the Divine
Spirit sunl< in the human body2.' This might equally be
called Neo-Platonic.

Such language tended to a certain fiuidity, as
Dr Inge calls it, in the use of the word θεὸς, which
is not without parallel in Hebrew literature. It is
a consideration which we cannot afford to neglect. The
Christian psychologist cannot but detect a rhetorical
ring about some of the sentiments thus expressed even
by orthodox Fathers.

What has Novatian to tell us about the relation os
human nature to the Divine Spirit? His psychology is
limited to the dualism of caro and mens (anima), which
he contrasts with the ‘ simplicity‘ of the Divine Nature
as an ‘alloy of bodily elements' (c. V, p. 18, 1. 5, cf. xxv,
p. 92, l. 12): as regards the action of the Divine Spirit
(who is ‘inhabitator corporibus nostris‚’ xxix, p. 109,
1. lo) on the human spirit, he is content to say that
the mind progresses by understanding to the ‘spirit,'
until ‘changed itself in spirit' it can know something
more about God3 with which we may compare i, p. 3,
ll. 11, 12, ‘He gave him mind, reason and prudence, that
he might be able to imitate God.' This does not take
us further than a ‘similitudo Dei? On the other hand,
we read that the Holy Spirit is the ‘ Renewer of those
who are dead in sin' (vii, p. 23, ll. 18, 19), this involving
