He can only be seen in His work-s, sor His glory blinds
the mental vision, even as the sun dazzles the eyes¹.
But the Son is visible at will. Novatian repeatedly
pronounces Him ‘the image of God the Father²'‚ who
is seen at work in the acts of Christ; for Christ is ‘the
imitator of the Father's works³.' Just as Tertullian (adu.
Praxean xiv, xv) holds that even before the Incarna-
tion ‘the Word was seen in a figure (in aenigmate), in
dreams and visions,’ Novatian recognises in the angelic
visitations of the Old Testament the manifestations of
Him who is ‘angelus pariter et deus⁴.' As Tertullian

dispensation‘³: so that by seeing the image of the Father
in the Son, a man may feel as if he had already seen
the Father7. This was the meaning of the answer given
to St Philipss. Consistently with this view, we read in
ch. xxxi that there is One alone who is invisible,
whom human faculties cannot grasp: for any other view
would involve a ditheism. Thus far, Novatian is in
practical agreement with Tertullian, in contrasting the
Invisible God with the Son in whom He is visible⁹.

But he has to controvert the position of those who
