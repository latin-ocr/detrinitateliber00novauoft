passi0ne1'). It is possible that these expressions, on
which a different construction may be placed, are simply
unguarded: otherwise they disallow the perfectior] of
Christ's Humanity and the true freedom of His human
Will. Had the writer followed out the mediatorial
doctrine into its ultimate bearings, he would scarcely
have left his words as they stand. As it is, beyond the

that salvation is in Him alone3, and that He bestows
immortality and perpetual salvati0n⁴‚ soteriology proper
receives little notice.

iii. In chapters xi, xxiii, xxiv we find a statement
of that which was called by later theologians the ‘hypo-
static union.’ It receives a simple expression in the
words of ch. xv, ‘homo est enim cum deo iunctus, et
deus cum homine copulatus⁵.' Tertullian had sought
to state it in philosophical terms of a sort: ‘uidemus
duplicem statum, non confusum, secl coniunctum in una
persona, deum et hominem Iesum⁶’; and again, ‘cum
dnae substantiae censeantur in Christo Iesu⁷.⁷ We have
already alluded to a certain resemblance in Novatian’s
teaching to that which was afterwards known as Nes-
torianism. It was the essence of that doctrine to draw
a sharp dividing line between the Godhead and the
Manhood in Christ, ‘to treat them as separate personal
existences, as though a man and God were joined to-
gether, so that our Lord was not one Person but two
Persons, and no real union of God and man was effected
