Vicar of St Stephen's, Shepherd's Bush, and to the Rev.
H. R. Joynt, Rector of Marlmbury, for the use of some
valuable books; and lastly‚ to my brother, ΜΓ F. Portet·
Faus-set, of the Inner Temple, who (lid some useful work
for me in the British Museum. But my chief thanks are
due to Dr Mason, the General Editor of the Cambridge
Patristic Texts. It is not easy to express in a few words
what this little book owes to his continuous criticism
and encouragement, and, in many passages, to his actual
collaboration. I have drawn freely upon his great stores
of theologica] and patristic learning. Many of the inter-
pretations to be found in the Commentary represent the
result of prolonged consultation between us3 and I have
had the privilege of discussing with him the larges aspects
of Novatian's theology. This general acknowledgment of
Dr Mason's unwearied kindness has to stand in place of
any acknowledgment in detail. He has bestowed more
pains upon the work of another than some men bestow
upon their own.
