nemo igitur Christum, sicut angelum non dubitat

dicere, ita etiam deum haesitet pronuntiare, cum hunc eundem

angelum aut intellegere, aut intellegendum esse contenderit, in

that the clause salls under the in-
fluence of ‘quasi.’ The argument
is this: Jacob in invoking the bless-
ing of God who is at the same time
the Angel, crosses his hands as he
lays them on the boys' heads, and
by that mystical action indicates
that it is Christ who is bestowing
the blessing in his person. ‘Quasi
pater illorum esset Christus': it was
naturally the father⁷s office to bless.
The idea that Christ was prefigured
in the crossed hands is found in
Tert. de Bapt. 8.

ing chapters in the old edd.

3. ‘Since he perceives that Ile
was invoked, for the blessing of
these lads‚ as alike God and Angel,
through the mysterious sign (sacra-
mentum) of the passion given in the
crossing os hands)

XX. But supposz‘ng [lle llerelic

Angels, though subject to Christ, arc

in the text. Painelius inserts dii,
iure et Deus Clzrislus after dicuntur,
partly, he says ‘ex editione Gagnaei
priori‘; in which itisprobably asheer
interpolation, as Gelenius omits it.
But it only confuses the premisses
of the argument, which runs thus:
‘all things in heaven and earth and
under the earth are subject to Christ,
including the Angels: yet any Angel
may be called a god; afar-tz'ori then
Christ is rightly called God! The
former premiss is based on Eph.
i 22. The latter premiss partly on
