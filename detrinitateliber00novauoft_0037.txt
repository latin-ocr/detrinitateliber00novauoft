popular exposition, of logical arrangement of ideas, and
of Scriptural exegesis, but not that of metaphysical
insight. His purpose is didactic and practical. And
so we find that his Christology is no less subordinationist
than Tertullian’s‚ except in one particular: he allows
room for the conception of an absolute and eternal dis-
tinction in the Godhead, when he allows that Divine
relations are timeless1. It may be added that in ch. xviii
he adapts Tertullian's figure of the sun and its rays for
the purpose of a fine description of the gradual self-
revelation of God's Image to man2. Stil] he can only
maintain the unity of the Godhead by positing a
‘procession' of the Son from the Father which is no
less subordinationist than that of Tertullian.

There is nothing in the conception of the Son’s
subordination to conflict with the orthodoxy of a later
time. Even such a theologiam as Dr Liddon can write
thus, referring to St John xiv 28 ὁ Πατήρ μου μείζων

essential Deity, His words still express very exactly a
truth which is recognised and required by the Catholic
doctrine. The subordination of the Everlasting Son to
the Everlasting Father is strictly compatible with the
Son's absolute Divinity; it is abundantly implied in
our Lord's language3 and it is an integral element of
the ancient doctrine which steadily represents the
Father as Alone Unoriginate‚ the Fount of Deity in
the Eternal Life of the Ever-blessed Trinity³.' The
utmost that need be said of Novatian’s language is that

supra n. 1, p. xxxii: and cp. de Trz'n. xxviii, p. 103, ll. 23 sq.
