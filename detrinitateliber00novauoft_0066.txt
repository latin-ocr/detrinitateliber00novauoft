But whatever ‘person' may have come to signify in
later thought, in the early writers ‘persona’ is a term
simply chosen to indicate, for no human term could ex-
press, the distinctions in the Divine Essence which we 6311
the Trinity. So the standing formula in Tertullian is ‘una
substantia tres Personae ’; and of baptism he says, ‘nec
semel, sed ter, ad singula nomina in Personas singulas
tinguimur’ (adu. me. xxvi). On what principle was
this term chosen? That it was chosen with deliberation
we are certain: the early fathers were reluctant to go
beyond the letter of Scripture‚ but the strange specula-
tions of the Gnostics compelled them to interpret and
comment, and sormulate. In the case of this particular
word, it was not necessary to do more than to refine
upon a usage already to be found, in a verbal way, in
2 Corinth. i 11, ii lo, and perhaps iv 6, if the old Latin
versions gave ‘persona' as the equivalent of πρόσωπον
there. From the original sense of a 1016 01 character
in a play, the word persona came, in classical usage, to

rights and duties². Hence, starting from this legal

2 Refer to a note on ‘persona,’ πρόσωπον, by Mr Bethune-Baker in
Texts and Stztclics‚ vol. vii (Cambridge, 1901), p. 70 sq.; who says ‘It is
the condicio, slatus, munus which any one has among men in general, and
in particular in civil life. And so it is the man himself so far as he has
this or that persona. Thus slaves, as not possessing any rights of citizen-
ship, were regarded by Roman law as not having persona: they were
