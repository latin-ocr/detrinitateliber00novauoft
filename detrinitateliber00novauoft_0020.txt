rests on the testimony of his rival, that in time of perse-
cution he went into retirement, and when implored by
the deacons to bring comfort to his suffering brethren,
replied that he wished to be a presbyter no longer and
was a lover of a different philosophy1. Possibly he
was more zealous in theological study than in the fulfil-
ment of the pastoral office. Socrates has a tradition
that he suffered as a martyr in the persecution of Valerian
(after ΑΒ. 257).

Novatian is not the only instance which Church
history furnishes of a man of uncloubted spirituality
and high intellectual endowments‚ in whom some one
austere or even morbid conviction‚ gaining impetus from
an autocratic temper, has overborne the larger principles
of charity and Catholicity2. We may regret that Cor-
nelius could characterise a learned fellow-Christian as a
‘cunning and malignant creature.' But when the same
writer refers to him ironically in the same letter as ‘this
marvellous man,' ‘the brilliant‚' ‘the dogmatist‚' ‘the
champion of ecclesiastical science‚' ‘the vindicator of
the Gospel³‚' he preserves for us, unintentionally‚ the
encomiums which the admirers of the schismatic
lavished upon him. The rare culture and eloquence
of Novatian could not be clenied‚ but it was easy to
accuse him of being a ‘better philosopher than Christian⁴,’
