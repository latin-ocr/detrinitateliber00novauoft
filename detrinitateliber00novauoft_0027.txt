heretics‚ ‘who blaspheme against the Holy spirits had
hawked the Libellus de Tm'm'tale of Tertullian about
the streets of Constantinople at a small price, having
incorporated it with the Epz'stles of Cyprian, whose
authority they wished to claim for their heresy. Jcrome
pronounces this a twofold falsehoocl, saying that the
work is neither Cyprian's nor Tertullian's but Novatian's,
‘cuius et inscribitur titulo et auctoris eloquium styli

Some perplexity has been created by Jerome's
description of the work as an epitome of a work of
Tertullian'S. There is nothing in the writings of the
latter except the aduersus Praxean which can come
into consideration: he has left no treatise dc Trz'm‘lale.
And our treatise is (listinctly longer than the adn.
Praxean, and also contains some thoughts which reinind
us rather of Irenaeus than of Tertullian2.

The theory proposed by ΜΓ J. Quarry that the
de Trz'nz‘tate is a translation from a lost Greek original,
probably the work of Hippolytus against Artemon, finds
no supportersss. It is amazing to find that scholar
speaking of ‘the very barbarous air of the work as a
Latin co1nposition.' As a writer Novatian can hold his
own with Tertullian or Cyprian ; enough has been said
already⁴ of the independent merits of his style, as it
may be judged from his acknowledged writings.

The preservation of the treatise‚ after the writer's
schismatic action had discredited him in the eyes of
