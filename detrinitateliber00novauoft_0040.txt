ξ 4. Tlce Fre—existence of tlte Son of God.

Α careful study of the system of Praxeas as far as we
can gather it from Tertullian's treatise will shew that he
denied the pre-existence of the Son, in holding that God
the Father became incarnate in the Person of Christ¹‚
in other words, that before the Incarnation the Son had
no existence2. Even the Catholic writers who contro-
verted this Patripassian teaching base the Tri-personality
of God on the claims of the work of redemption. The
Trinity is in danger of becoming a mere ‘oeconomy‚'
as in the systems controverted3. The eternal existence
of the Logos in the Father is, in Tertullian, rather formal
than real; for he can compare it with the existence of
unuttered speech in a human mind, suggestive as an
illustration‚ but not an adequate parallel. Again, his
application of the words of Isaiah ‘ego primus et in
superuentura ego sum ' in connexion With St John's ‘in
principio erat sermo,' is this: that the Word was be-
gotten in the beginning (‘in principio prolatus⁷), whereas
the Father has no beginning t‘initiurn'), as being be-
gotten of none: and this ‘beginning’ of the Word.
Tertullian seems to connect in that passage with God's
purpose os Creation. In fact in his desire to escape the
charge of ditheism, he approximates to that Gnostic
doctrine of Aeons‚ which at the beginning of the same
chapter he combats4.
