He is immanent in His world: in the one case man
obeys a law, in the other he realizes his own higher
nature. The circles of view will intersect, and thus
common points are found. (a) There is a Christian
pantheism, the pantheism of S. Paul when he said, ‘in
Him we live and move and have our being,’ and spoke
of the Divine Will ‘to sum up all things in Christ1’:
but it must be sharply distinguished from that vague
modern pantheism which can see no difference, save of
degree, between God and His creature man. St Paul
studiously avoids the Stoic ancl neo-Platonic phraseology
of deification. (b) There is the conviction that the
individual is only himself when he remembers that he
exists in and for the whole‘2. Thus social service
emerges as the ideal of conduct.

There is a strong resemblance between these
Christian theories of Deification and the modern effort‚
rather Stoic than Christian, to find in Christ an apo-
theosis of humanity not really unique. But in the
former we recognise the tendency to exalt man to the
level of God, in the latter to lower God to the level
of man. In each some important elementis under-
estimated. In the latter, the Catholic Christian of every
age would note that the fact of sin receives an inter-
pretation which is unknown to Holy Scripture and fails
to satisfy the deepest convictions of the human heart;
