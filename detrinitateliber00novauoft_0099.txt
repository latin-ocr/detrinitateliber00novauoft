DE TA‘lNH'A TE LlHElt·

nec hoc in loco plura persequar, quae annuntiata de

Christo omnibus haereticis sed et ipsis ueritatem tenentibus

magis nota sunt.

X. Sed illud admoneo, non alterum in euangelio Christum
exspectandum fuisse, quam hunc a creatore ueteris testamenti 5
litteris ante promissum 3 maxime cum et quae de ipso praedicta
sunt impleta sint, et quae impleta sunt ante praedicta sint. ut
merito haereticorum istorum testamenti ueteris auctoritatem
respuentium nescio cui commenticio et ex fabulis anilibus ficto
Christo atque fucato possim uere et constanter dicere: “quis
es? unde es? a quo missus es? quare nunc uenire uoluisti?

2. ‘To all heretics, and even
more so to those who hold the
truth.' The arrangement os Scrip-
tural proofs from ‘the law of Moses,
the prophetS, and the psalms’ re-
minds us of Luke xxiv 44.

X. T lze heretiss posit on ima-
ginary Christ, of whom tlte O.T.
knows nothing. We cannot under-
stand lzow such α C lzrz'st could have
come: lze would slave stood in no
intellzssqible relation to man and tlze
universe. T lze cult of susle a Christ
would be blasphemy against tlte
Fatlzeoe nor could lte give man
salvatz'on from sin or xlae scope of
resurrection. Τ ltere is no witness
tn tlte Law and Prophets to susle
a Christ. Why did lae wear tlze
semblance if lle holed tlze realz'ty of
α body? lf lte ‘zoas a phantom, all
lle did was plmntasm too: rs lte
wore only a ‘siderent body‚’ lze is
not tlze Saviour of tlzc human body.
But He submittat to tlte law of
deatlz, and exlzz'bited z'n His own
Body tlte law os resurrection. [Vol

fleslz is. excludedfivm tlte lstngdom.

7. ‘So thatin the face os those
heretics who disdain the authority
of the Old Testament, Ι might with
justice address their imaginary
Christ, the specious creation of old
wives' fables, in words of uncom-
promising truth.’ ‘Merito’ denotes

as in pp. 161. 6, 491. 19 logical ne<
cessity or the requirements osconsist-
ent statement. ⁶ Haereticorum‘ to
be taken with ‘Christo,' as p. 33 l. 5
‘eum haereticorum Christum.' The
heretics whom this chapter refutes
are the Docetae (especially Marcion
and his follower Apelles), and the
Gnostics. Marcion drew a sharp
contrast between the Old and New
Testaments, rejecting the former in
a rationalistic spirit (cp. l. 8 ⁴ testa-
menti ueteris auctoritatem respuen-
tium⁷). The Gnostics did not deny
hut allegorised the O.T.

9. commenticio eet.] Both Doce-
tae and Gnostics distinguished the
Heavenly Christ from the man
Jesus; they ‘evaded the Incarnation
because of its real contact with
matter.' Of Marcion Tertullian says
(de Carne Christi i) ‘qui carnem
Christi putatiuam introduxit, aeque
potuit natiuitatem quoque phantasma
confingere-⁵ The Syrian Gnostics
also taught that the whole visible
appearance of Christ was a phantom,
and <lenied His birth. (Consult
