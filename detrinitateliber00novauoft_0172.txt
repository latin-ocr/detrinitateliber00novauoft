dei patris omnipotentis perfectam contemplationem‚—et quo-

niam, qui hoc animo ac mente combiberit et de omnibus sic -

futurum esse crediderit, patrem, quem uisurus sit, quasi iam

quodammodo uiderit et hic iam sic habeat, quasi teneat, quod
5 habiturum se pro certo sciat.

Ceterum, si ipse pater fuisset, quid quasi futurum praemium
repromittebat, quod iam praestiterat et dederat? nam quoniam
dicit: beati mundo carde, quia ipsi deum uidebant, polliceri
deprehenditur contemplationem et aspectum patris. ergo

10 nondum dederat: cur enirn repromitteret, si iarn dedisset?
dederat enim, si pater esset; uidebatur enim, et contingebatur.
quando autem, dum contingitur ipse Christus et uidetur, repro-
mittit tamen et dicit, quoniam qui mundo fuerit corde, deum
uidebit, hoc ipso probat patrem se non esse, qui tunc praesens

15 cum uideretur repromittebat, quod patrem uisurus esset quis-
quis mundo corde fuisset. erat ergo repromittens haec non
pater sed filius; quia qui filius erat, quod uideri habebat
repromittebat: cuius repromissio superuacua fuisset, nisi filius

fuisset. cur enim repromittebat mundis ut uiderent patrem,

in the cave of shadows ‘will re-
quire to grow accustomed before
he can attain to the sight os the
upper world,' and the whole context.
In Plato the ascent through ‘ images’
to the Idea of Good is an ascent
from that which is in process and
shadow to that which is: μάθημα
ψυχῆς ὁλκὸν ἀπὸ τοῦ γιγνομένου ἐπὶ
τὸ ὄν (ib. 521 D). Cp. R. L. Nettle-
ship, l'lzilosoplz. Romaim, pp. 366,
367. But we must not imagine that
Catholic writers, speaking of Christ
as the Image of the Father (cp.
Hebr. i 3, Philipp. ii 6. Col. ii 9),
implied a lower degree of reality
in Him. Novatian's view may be
further studied in c. xviii z'nil.

1. et, quonjam, quj hoe ...]
‘The [ruth is, also, that the man
who has taken this deep into his
heart and soul, and has entirely be-
lieved that thus it will be, has al-
ready seen, in a manner, the Father

whom he is to see hereafter, and
here already has, as if it were in
his grasp, that which he knows for
certain that he will one day have.’
The difficulty of this passage is due
to the fact that both ‘quasi' and
‘sic' occur respectively twice and in
different usages: the former ‘quasi '
merely qualifies ‘quodammod0‚’ the
former ‘sic’ refers to the same truth
as ‘hocs The main assertion is
contained in ‘uiderit...et...habeat.’
‘Hic’ means ‘here upon earth.'
El quoniam carries on the nisi quo-
niam, which expresses the actual
state of things (cp. p. 40. ²3 n.).
‘ De omnibus‚' an adverbial phrase
(cp. p. 3. 2 note) to be compared
with ‘omnibus modis' p. 101 l. 3.
