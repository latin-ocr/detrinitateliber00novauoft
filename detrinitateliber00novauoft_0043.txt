representing the pre-mundane Christ as θεὸς ὢν ἐν ἀρχῇ
πρὸς τὸν θεόν. Harnack takes 1 Pet. i 18 as a locus clas-
sicus for what he would consider the simpler and earlier
expression of this belief3 especially the words προεγνωσ-
μένου μὲν πρὸ καταβολῆς κόσμου, φανερωθέντος δέ κ.τ.λ.,
as parallel to the Rabbinical view of the Messiah, which
‘hypostatized the essence and exalted it above space
and time.'

It is interesting to observe that this view, which
limits the concept of pre-existence to God's predesti-
nation, is precisely the view which Novatian rejects in
favour of the fuller belief1; and it may justly be urged
that the passage in question refers to the sacrificial work
rather than to the Person of Christi and that Ι Peter
contains language which is, at the lowest, compatible
with the sullest belief in Christ's Divinity³.

Then again, Harnack denies that in the earliest
Christian writings there is any distinction between the
σάρξ and the πνεῦμα in Christ, for which he makes
St Paul responsible, quoting Rom. i 3. This he regards
as a Hellenizing transformation of the Jewish idea of the
Messiah ; which involves, by its distinction between the
’πνεῦμα ζωοποιοῦν (Ι Cor. xv 45) and the σάρξ its in-
adequate veil, the postulate of a pre-existent Spirit who
is Divine3 and thus for the φανεροῦσθαι of the Idea
St Paul substitutes its κενοῦσθαι or ταπεινοῦσθαι in
assuming flesh4. Thus the Pauline Christology would
be a recasting of the Hebraic notion of the Messiah in

¹ v. quotation from c. xvi supra.

2 Cp. St Peter's words in Acts ii 23 τῇ ὡρισμένῃ βουλῇ καὶ προ-γνώσει
τοῦ θεοῦ ἔκδοτον ἀνείλατε.

³ ii 3‚4: iii 15: iv 11.

⁴ And thus Greek Christians could suminarise Pauline Christology
as the so-called Clement does, Ep. ad Corinth. ii 9 5 Χριστὸς ὁ κύριος ὁ
σώσας ἡμᾶς, ὢν μὲν τὸ πρῶτον πνεῦμα, ἐγένετο σὰρξ καὶ οὕτως ἡμᾶς ἐκάλεσεν.
