the thought that in place of a sin-laden immortality
(i, p. 5, ll. 2—4) man comes to share the ‘Divine eternity⁷
of the Spirit through the obedience of holiness (xxix,
p. 109. 11—-p. 110. 1). It is only sin which prevents
corruptible man from growing into the likeness of the
incorruptible1 God. It is the Incarnation through which
flesh, the seat of corruption, is brought into contact with
Deity, Christ being ‘mediator Dei et hominum‚’ who in
Himself ‘ clasps into harmony things os earth and things
of heaven2.' It remains to add, that the whole argument
of chs. xiv, xv turns on the belief that mere man is not
and cannot conceivably become what Christ is: ‘since
man cannot do works like unto the heavenly works of
God’ (xiv, p. 47, l. 12).

Here Novatian leaves us having barely touched the
real problem of the kinship of the human and Divine
through the element called in the N.T. πνεῦμα. To
him the Divine generally appears as transcendent
rather than immanent3: a Power that enters ab exlra3
and the reconciliation of the ‘Deus’ and ‘homo’ in Christ
is but vaguely indicated. And similarly he asserts that
the will is free (i, p. 3. 15—p. 4. S), but does not examine
the content of the idea.

The question of the reconciliation of the human and
the Divine finds many answers in the course of human
thought. It may be said that the problem will always
elicit one of two types of solution: the one theocentric
and the other anthropocentric: in the former, God is
transcendent, above ancl outside His world, in the latter
