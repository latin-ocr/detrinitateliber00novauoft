IO NOVATJANI [III

propter institutionem: hunc inquam, qui dixit, el facta sunt
omnia 3 praecepit, et processerunt uniuersa 3 de quo scriptum est:
omnia in sapientia secistz} de quo Moyses: deus in caelo
sursum et ln terra deorsum 3 qui secundum Isaiam mensus est
caelum palma, terram pugillo .· qm' aspicit terram, et facit eam
tremere .· qui continet gyrum terrae, et eos qui habitant in ῥύεο
quasi locustae: qm· expendit montes in pondere, et nemora in
statera, id est certo diuinae dispositionis examine: ac, ne facile
in ruinam procumberet magnitudo inaequaliter iacens, si non
paribus fuisset librata ponderibus, onus hoc moderanter terrenae

molis aequauit.
est praeter me.

1. institutionem] ‘ordering‚'
with the idea of ‘instruction’ sor
intelligent beings, as explained
below (p. 11 ll. 11—13): ‘qua pater
conferre sapientiam, ' ⁸ ferinos animos
...ad lenitatem trahere uolens.' See
also n. on e. viii, p. 2511. 2, 5.

ib. Ps. cxlix 5, ciii (civ) 24:
Deut. iv 30.

4. Is. xl 12, Ps. ciii (civ) 32·

6. Is. xl 22 Vulg. ‘qui sedet
super gyrum terrae, et habitatores
eius sunt quasi locustae': ib. 12 ‘quis
appendit tribus digitis molem terrae,
et librauit in pondere montes, et
colles in statera?' In eh. xxx infin
the word is ‘suspendit.' ‘ Pondere‚'
⁸ 1)3.1;11166,’111116111116531116 as ‘state1·a.'
‘scales' The writer in his O.T.
quotations used a version made
from the Lxx, not, as the Vulgate‚
from the Hebreu thus zb. v. 22 ὁ

12. τίς ἔστησε τὰ ὄρη σταθμῷ καὶ
τὰς νάπας ςινγῷ; Cf. notes on ch.
ix and latroni. ξ 1, p. xx, note 3.

8. examine] prop. ‘tongue os
the balance‚’ so ‘the exactness’ of
the Divine distribution of elements.

poise, lest is it were not held in (lue

fabric should collapse and fall into
ruin': cp. Ps. ciii (civ) 5 ‘non in-
clinabitur in saeculum saeculi?
‘ Moderanter,' lit. ‘with controlling
force.’ This ancient argument fora
Creator gains a far wider scope of
application‚ when we regard the uni-
verse in the light of modern science:
every organism within it consisting
of co·ordinated parts in equilibriurn.
‘The living being resembles a deli-
catelyconstructed machine' (Stewart
and Tait, Unscen Universe, ch. vi).
Order prevails in the infinitesimal,
as well as 111 the infinitely great:
the most recent science has found
it within the atoni, which is now
itself ‹lisintegrated. ‘The laws of the
physical universe are mathematica]
relations* (Pi—of. Flint‚ lecz'sm, pp.
134). ‘Masses attract each other,
616111611154 combine with each other,
in invariable proportions’ (ih. 136,
quoting Is. xl 12, as in our text).
What was called the ‘argument from
(lesign' is better called the ‘argu-
ment from order and adaptation‚'
which maintains that the order which
actually exists was meant to exist
(Fluit, p. 164). This leads to the
idea of design‚ of a Causa causans,
a Creator Mind.
11. ego deus] Is. xlv 18. 22.
