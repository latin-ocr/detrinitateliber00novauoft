JNTROD (sc ’ΜΘΝ xl vii

implies that, though our Lord is ‘in the form of G‹;›d,’
it would have been usurpation on His part to claim an
equality with God: far frorn doing so, at His nativity
He took the form of a slave. (Here we may refer to
what has been said in ᾖ 3 about the ‘ subordination’ of the
Son.) It is not necessary to suppose that the idea of
service and obedience (‘morigera oboedientia,' p. 120,
l. 18) carries with it, in Novatian's mind, that of an
essential inferiority of the Son, which such a phrase as
‘substantiae communio' definitely excludes1. He would
. no doubt have assented to Tertullian's reference of the
‘unum sumus' of St John Χ 30 ‘ad dilectionem patris
qui filium diligit, et ad obsequium filii, qui uoluntati
patris obsequitur².' He attributes to the Son of God
the ‘natura dei' in the way of omnipresence‚ and the
‘uirtus dei’ and ‘uis diuinitatis³.’ But his position would
have been greatly strengthened had he grasped the
thought of ‘substantia' in its later metaphysical sense.
It is just here that Novatian fails to provide a
doctrine of Christ’s equality with the Father, which
shall give to his formula ‘Christus deus' its full content.
A good deal of stress is laid upon the oneness of Father
and Son (ego et pater unum sumus‚⁷ not ‘unus')‚ but it
is a moral and practical unity, described in such terms
as ‘concors patri suo deo inuentus‚’ ‘mmm per concor—
diam et per amorem et per dilectione1n⁴‚' rather than
an essentia] unity. This is most apparent in the analogy
drawn from the reciprocal relation of Paul and Apollos⁵.
