ξ 7. On the nse of tlte term ‘Person’ in regard to
Dez'ty.

A clear distinction must be made between the
theological use of the word, which we have in this
treatise‚ not quite for the first time in Christian litera-
ture, and the philosophical use, which is purely modern.
Of the latter it need only be said that the belief in a
Persona] God is contrasted with Pantheism and with
any form of Theism which represents God as Un-
knowable, as Impersonal Law, as the Infinite, and so
forth.

It has been said, with a certain truth, ‘Personality,
as we conceive it, is essentially a limitation and a
relation. Our own personality is presented to us as
relative and li1nited3 and it is from that presentation
that all our representative notions of personality are
derived. Personality is presented to us as a relation
between the conscious sels and the various modes of his
consciousness¹.’ ‘It is only by conceiving God as a
Conscious Being that we can stand in any religious
relation to Him at all...it is from the intense conscious-
ness of our own real existence as Persons that the
conception of reality takes its rise in our minds: it is
through that consciousness alone that we can raise
ourselves to the saintest image of the supreme reality
of God2.'

Hzmmn and Divina, L. iii, n. 12), shewing that in God alone there is
Personalsty, without limit but self—deterrnining, as Lotze says, ‘Perfect
personality is in God alone.’
