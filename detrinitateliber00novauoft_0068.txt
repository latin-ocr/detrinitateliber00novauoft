‘personality' is under discussion. It is another matter
to imagine that we can get behind these theological
terms to the supposed simplicity of primitive Christianity.
A school of thinkers has attempted to eliminate meta-
physics from theology, and to draw a sharp distinction
between religious ‘value-judgments' and the theoretic
judgments of philosophy. But no satisfying system of
thought has resulted. A place must be found for human
reason, beside Revelation and the spiritual and moral

facusties, in any true theology.
