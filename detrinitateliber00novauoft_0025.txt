with its varied antiquarian learning and its exposition
of the ‘monarchia’ of God and the sulfilment of Jewish
prophecy in the Coming of Christ, has an even stronger
claim to be included in the Opera Novatiana from its

animated discussion in German and English reviews.
Batiffol supposes that Origen was the author of a Greek
original, translated by Victorinus of Pettau. Weyman
and others maintain that the Latin is original, and the
work of Novatian. This theory is maintained with much
