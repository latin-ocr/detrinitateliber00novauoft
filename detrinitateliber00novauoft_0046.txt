Trinity. (e) Finally, it is incumbent on the student
to remember that the word itself, as Christ spoke it,
is greater than all interpretations‚ for it is Spirit and
Life; and that it is vain for the critic to object to the
central place of the ‘Christological question in the
Gospel of Christ¹.’ The word spoken cannot be
separated from the W'ord who spake. ‘The Christ of
the Church is the dominant fact of the history of the
race, and humanitarianism is inadequate, with its drastic

ξ 5. Tlae Person of Christ, according 2⁴0 Novatian.

Novatian has been charged with more than one
heresy in regard to the Person of Christ. According to
the Danish scholar, V. Ammundaen, Epiphanius places
him between Sabellius and Noetus as an upholder of
the same tenets33 and though he himself does not
endorse the charge, or even deny Novatian his place in
the line of development which issued in the Nicene
teaching, he goes so far as to say that, if we judge
the work frorn the standpoint of a later orthodoxy, a
whole series of heresies will corne to light in it, Arianism‚
Apollinarism, Nestorianism and Adoptianism. We need
not however follow Ammundsen to these lengths, as a
careful examination of the teaching of the Treatise will
shew.
