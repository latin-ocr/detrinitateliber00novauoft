Tertullian (Virga Vel. i, adu. Prax. i 16, ap. Swete,
p. 107), and in pamplerase in our text¹.

In view of the important issues at stake, any evidence
for the original form of the Roman Symbol is to be
welcomed. Harnack holds that it was based upon ‘the
baptisma} formula and confessional formulas of a sum-
marising character...including Eastern formulas,' and
originated about the middle of the second century. But
there are valid grounds for believing that it had its
prototypes also in the East, baptismal (and Trinitarian)
confessions. Hasnack will not admit their existence,
and yet there is evidence for them which cannot be
hastily rejected: notably‚ the κανὼν τῆς ἀληθείας asso-
ciated by Irenaeus with baptism2‚ and the περὶ πίστεως
’γραφή (‘ received from the bishops before us') laid by
Eusebius of Caesarea before the Council of Nicaea in
325.

The first Section of the de Triuitate relates to God
the Father (chs. i—viii); the second to God the Son
(chs. ix—xxviii); the third section to God the Holy
Ghost (ch. xxix). The last two chapters (xxx, xxxi)
form a complementary section, setting forth the unit)-
of the Godhead especially as against Adoptianist and
against Patripassian heretics (of the school of Sabellius).

1 Reasons are given for accepting ‘unum' in n. on c. ix, p. 28. 6.
The whole question os the presence of this word ‘One’ in the original
Roman Creed is a difficult one: Zahn supposes it was introduced on anti· ”
Gnostic grounds and afterwards omitted to counteract Monarchian teach-
ing; and Burn takes a similar view, holding also that Tertullian’s Creed
probably contained ‘unum‚' but that in that of Novatian it is missing (op.
cit. p. 58). Loofs (Swnbolik i 6. 3) cannot decide: Harnack denies its
presence in R (Apostles-² Creed, Eng. tr. p. 72); and doubtless its presence
there would strengthen the position of those who trace R back to Eastern
(perhaps Johannine) sources.

the Ante-Nicene period.
