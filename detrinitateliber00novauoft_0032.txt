xxviii [NTA’OD σε TJON

Though the treatise now bears on its title-page the
theological term ‘Trinity,’ this terrn occurs nowhere in
the text, as though the writer had intentionally avoided
it ; for the word ‘Trinitas ' (Τριάς) occurs in Theophilus
of ⁴{ntioch‚ Hippolytu5‚ and Tertullian.

The distribution of the subject over the Chapters
indicates of itself that the predominant question for
the writer is the relation of our Lord to the Father
as it is conditioned by the Incarnation, and the union
in Him of the two natures. The doctrine of the Holy
Ghost is so slightly handled‚ that certain heretics
claimed the treatise in support of their own views1.
Unquestionably Novatian never speaks of Him as ‘tertia
persona' or even as ‘deus’: he is content with the
designations ‘spiritus sanctUS,' ‘paraclitus,' ‘spiritus
ueritatis,’ and in one place (c. xxiX, p. 110, 11), ‘spiritus
dei? But the writer so enlarges on the operation of
the Holy Spirit in the soul and in the Church, as to
leave no doubt that he, no less than Tertullian, held
the doctrine of His Personality'2.

A strange dislocation of pages occurred in the arche-
type MS of our ancient copies of this Treatise: by which
the section beginning ‘ex quo manus' (end of ch. xix,
page 73, first line) and ending with ‘sed filium compro-
basse’ (the last words of ch. xxvii, page 100, second
line) was transposed so as to follow the words towards
the end of chapter xiv ‘illuc redit ubi prius fuit' (page
47, line 28). Thus the old editions (such as that of
Parnelius) begin their ch. xxiii with ‘quod si de caelo,'
and thus to the end of the Treatise. Subjoined is a
comparative table of chapters in the old editions, and
in XVelchman’s (who restored the right orde1·):
