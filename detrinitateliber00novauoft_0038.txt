xxxiv [NTROD UCTJON

it is sometimes unguarded. Generally‚ he describes the
relationship of the Son to the Father by such terms as
‘ oboedientia,' ‘subditus,' ‘subiectus,' ‘ minister‚' ‘angelus'
and ‘minor patre1.’ The writer, in his desire to contro-
vert the Sabellian confusion of Persons in the Godhead
(according to which ‘ Filius Dei' and ‘Deus Pater' were
not equal‚ but identical), fails to emphasise their trans-
cendental equality. And yet even the expression ‘minor
Patre' has the highest Authority‚ and may signify
precedence not in essence but in personality2.

It would be well if theologians had always remem-
bered, in discussing the mysteries of the Divine Nature,
that the terms and the logical processes‚ through which
alone the subject can be presented, are human and ipso
facto inadequate. In this question of the subordination
of the Son to the Almighty Father who is the ‘ Fount of
Deity³,' the significant fact is that of obedz'ence, the fulfil-
ment of the Divine Will; and it is probable that the
thought os inferiority, which man cannot but associate
with that of service, is utterly alien from the thought of
the Divine Mind. ln the Divine Life there may be an
interchange of energy of which the conditions are but
dimly discernible to us through the hints of revelation.
It has already been remark-ed that inferiority in the sense
of posteriority 2'72 time does not enter into the writer's
conception of the subordination of the Son. He exalts
the Son far above all created existences. It may indeed

⁴2 Harnack, like many others, credits Nov. with the doctrine that the
Son when His work is finished will cease to exist independently, but there
is nothing in c. xxxi (to which he refers) to justify this. Cp. n. on xxxi,
p. 122, l. 12.
