Son’s Godhead to the Father, spoken of in that passage,
is not a future thing, but an ever present fact. It is
the movement by which the union of the Son with the
Father is maintained. The passage must be taken in

salvation of the human race⁴. It was the necessary
condition of that salvation, that man and God should
be brought into accord through a Mediator⁵‚ who is not
