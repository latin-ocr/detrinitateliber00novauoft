[xV, xvi

ita quod ad crimen blasphemiae pertinet, filium se non

patrem dicit: quod autem ad diuinitatem spectet ipsius, ego et
pater omme snmus dicendo, filium se esse et deum probauit.
deus est ergo: deus autem sic, ut filius sit, non pater.

XVI.

Si homo tantummodo Christus, quomodo ipse dicit: 16

et omnis qni uidet et credit in me non morietur in aeternum?
sed enim qui in hominem solitarium credit et nudum, male-
dictus dicitur: hic autem, qui credit in Christum non male-

dictus, sed in aeternum non moriturus refertur.
10 aut homo est tantum, ut haeretici uolunt, quomodo quisquis

ex quo si

in eum credit non morietur in aeternum, cum maledictus
esse teneatur qui confidit in homine? aut si non maledictus,
sed potius ad aeternae uitae consecutionem, ut legitur, desti-
natus, non homo tantummodo Christus, sed et deus3 in quem

iustitiae accedit.

XVI. lf Christ is mere man,
how can He promise eternal lzfe to
every one who oclz'eveth 072 Isim? sor
α curse is pronounced on those who
trust in mon. Agaz'n, how can He
say the Paraclete will talee os what
is His and declaro it? for the
Paracletc does not receive knowledge
from man out imparis z't to him.
ll follows tlmt Christ either dcccives
ns, which is unthz'nhable: or the
paraclete, receiving from Christ, is
less than Christ. T his proves Christ
to be God.

Again, why cloes He place Hz'mself
beside God, wilhoul distinction of
Dez'ly, in the rnle offizilh laid down
in Jo. xvii 3? Why does He spcak
os the gloaey lle had with the Father
before the world was? from which
H z's pre-existence necessarily follows ,-
jor mere man could only hove had
it after the world began. T lzz's
cannot he explained away by pre-
destination, which we dare not in-
teoepolale in the Sacred Text. It
follows that Christ ‘zoas in substance

before the foundation of the world.
But assuming predestination, it
must correspond in Gozl’s purpose to
the order os time: and thus Christ
would be subsequen! to others, Adam,
Abel and the patrias-cos.

6. omnis qui uidet] Jo. xi 26
Vulg. ‘uiuit‚’ after the Greek. Prob-
ably (as jackson says) N. has con-
fused the passage with Jo. vi 40.

7. Jerem. xvii 5. Cp. p. 35. 7.

9. si aut homo est] The alter-
natives are stated in a confused
way: we might have expected (in
line 12) ‘ aut si deus’: but N. alters
the point of contrast, and writes as
if the former member had been
‘maledictus erit quisquis in eum
credit.' The first aut is in fact
pleonastic.

12. teneatur] so in pp. 36. 8,
49. 1, of holding aview: in ch. xxx
the word is thrice coupled in this
sense with credere. But perhaps
here there is the idea of ‘ maledic-
tione teneri’: ‘is placed under a

curse.’
