l. 11 ‘nobis uult religiosam..con-
ferre sapientiam.’ ‘For we find in
Scripture that God is called Charity;
it does not therefore follow that the

substance of God is expressed in the
term “Charity.’' Again‚ because
He is called Light‚ it does not
follow that the substance of God is
contained in this. The whole is
predicated of God only as far as it
applies. So that with good reason
again, when He is called a spirit, it
is not an exhaustive definition (lit.
He is not called the whole of what
He is): the purpose is, that, when
man’s mind progresses as far as
the conception of Spirit‚ having
itself undergone a spiritual change,
it may be enabled, through the
spirit, to conclude that God is
something even greater.’ The latter
