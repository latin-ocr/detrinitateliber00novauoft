phrases as Arian1. But in such a case all emendation
must remain conjectural.

ii. As regards the date of the de Trinz'late, Dr
Harnack supports the view which has approved itself
to most writers, that it was written before Novatian's
lapse into schism, which occurred in A.D. 251. The
reference to Sabellius²‚ who was a disciple of Noetus,
would indicate a date somewhere about ΑΒ. 25Ο; while
the work must be placed after the date of Tertullian's
adu. Praxean, which Bardenhewer gives as 217 or 213³.
The view of Hagemann (Rom. Kirche, p. 401), that it was
a controversia] tract written in support of Hippolytus
in his dispute with the Roman Church, is purely con-
jectural.

iii. The treatise falls into four main divisions. The
first three answer to the Roman Creed, which may be
reconstructed in part, as Novatian knew it, from the
opening words of these divisions‚ somewhat as follows:

‘Credo in Deum [unum] Patrem et Dominum omni-
potentem [rerum omnium conditorem]: et in Filium Dei,
Christum Iesum, Dominum Deum nostrum: credo· etiam
in Spiritum Sanctum [ecclesiae repromissum].'

The words printed in brackets seem to the present
writer to have had, in all probability, a place in
Novatian’s Regula uastatis& although not so considered
by Dr Swete (Apostlcs⁷ Creed, p. 108, ‘ Rule of Faith acc.
to Nov.') or (for the most part) by Dr Burn (Introduction
2‘0 tlze crecti, p. 46); they are found in substance in
